Selection sort is an in place algorithm.
Two partitions are made out of the unsorted list: sorted and unsorted partitions.
(Given that we want to sort the input in ascending order),
Looping over the input, the current smallest element in the unsorted partition is selected, then removed from this partition and
pushed into the sorted one. This selection process is repeated until no more elements are remained into the
unsorted partition.
