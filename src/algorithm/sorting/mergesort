Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm (Divide, Conquer, Combine).

It works in the following way:
Given an array,
the array is divided into two equal parts. Then, each part is once again divided into two equal parts.
This division process is repeated recursively until we are only left with parts of length 1 (parts that can no longer be divided).
Once this Divide step achieved, individual items are combined in *almost the same way they were divided.
*almost: before combining two them, the parts are compared first in order to combine them in a sorted way.
