Insertion sort is another type of inplace algortihms (just as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort).
The strategy of this algorithm relies on the following process:
For every element in the list, compare it to all the element on its left side.
If it is less than one of them, insert it into the right position.

Space Complexity
