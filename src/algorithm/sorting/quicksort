Quick sort works in the following way:
Given an array,
a pivot is chosen.
a left and right pointers are chosen.

the array is sorted using the pivot as a reference point:
all elements to the left of the pivot that are greater than the pivot
are moved to the right side of the pivot
and all elements to the right of the pivot that are less than the pivot
are moved to the left side of the pivot

then take whats to the left of the pivot as a new partition and repeat.
then take what to the right of the pivot as a new partition and repeat.
