Hashtable is a key value lookup data structure. It provided fast lookups.

A hashtable uses a hash function to store and lookup values.

Once a hash function is determined, a hash for each key is generated.
Then, this hash is converted into an index (index = hash_code % initial_table_size).

A good hash function must provide fast lookups, even distribution and minimization of collisions.

When a collision occurs, chaining is used: we build a linked list to store the elements that have the same key.

Killer features:
search, insert and delete have a O(1) time complexity in the best case.

However, in the worst case (when lots of collisions occur), the worst time complexity is O(n)
