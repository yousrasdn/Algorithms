Binary tree

Characteristics:
Each node has at most two children.

Three types of binary trees:

o Full      binary tree: a tree where each node has either zero or two children
o Perfect   binary tree: a tree where each node has exactly two children (example: a family tree)
o Balanced  binary tree: a tree that has the minimum possible depth.


To search an item in a tree, there are two types of algorithms:
o Depth   First Search
o Breadth First Search

There are 3 types of DFS:
- In order traversal: traverse the left subtree first, then visits the root, then traverses the right subtree.
- Pre order traversal: visit the root node, then traverses the left subtree, then the right subtree.
- Post order traversal: travers the left subtree then the right subtree, and finally visits the root.


Binary Search Tree:

It is a tree where at each node n,
the left child is less than n, and the right child is greater than n => this tree stores items in a sorted order.

The runtime of insert, delete and find is O(log n), meaning that we have to make log n iterations to reach the desired node.
