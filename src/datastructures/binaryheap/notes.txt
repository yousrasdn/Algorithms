Binary Heap:

Two types: binary heap MAX and binary heap MIN

A binary heap is a binary tree data structure that stores either the smallest or the largest element on the top of the tree.

The higher priorities elements are at the top, and the lowest priorities elements are at the bottom.

Runtime Characteristics:
peeking (retrieving the min item when it's a Heap Min BT, or the max item in case of a Heap Max BT): O(1)

extracting the min or max: O(log n) since we need to maintain the order, we have to heapify down

inserting: O(log n) we have to heapify up to maintain the heap order.

We can use a binary heap to find the shortes path, for priority queues.
