Things to know:
Arrays:
1-Can contain anything
2-Have a fixed size
3-Elements can be randomly accessed with O(1) time


The killer features of array are:
1-get(int index)'s complexity is O(1)
2-set(int index, T value)'s complexity is O(1)

However, insert(int index's complexity is O(n)
because in the worst case we have to shift all elements to the right => O(n)
