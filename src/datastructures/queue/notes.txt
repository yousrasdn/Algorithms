Queue:
FIFO principle => First In, First Out

operations: add (queue) and remove (dequeue)

Using a single list implementation,
    When adding, we add to the tail.
    When removing, we remove from the head. Because if we removed from the tail, it will take us linear time (O(n)).

Killer feature: add and remove in O(1)
