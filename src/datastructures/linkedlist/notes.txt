a list is a serie of nodes linked together.

A linked list starts with a Head and ends with a Tail. In the middle, we find Nodes.

 H              N          T
["a" - o]->["b" - o]->["c" - o] -> null

In contrast to array,
a linked list has no random access. Thus get and set operations have a time complexity of O(n).
does not have a fixed capacity. Thus, it can grow incrementally.

Killer feature:
Ability to insert and delete in O(1).
