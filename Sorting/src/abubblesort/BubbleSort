Bubble sort algorithm relies on a simple swapping strategy. It consists of swapping adjacent elements that are out of order by continuously
moving upward in the list of inputs. As long as there was at least one element swapped in the previous pass, another pass is performed.
The elements are bubbled up until they occupy their right position.

Space Complexity
This alogirthm is in place. When sorting, the only extra space we needed was a temp variable to help with the swapping of elements.
Thus, the space complexity is O(1).

Time Complexity
At the worst case, we have to make (n-1) passes through the list. In each pass, we make (n-1) comparisons.
This implies that the time complexity is (n-1)(n-1) which is O(n^2).

At the best case (when the array is already sorted), we only perform one pass in which (n-1) comparaisons are performed.
Hence, the time complexity is Ω(n).
